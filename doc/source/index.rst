Welcome to qopt. In this documentation you will find everything you need to
know about qopt to simulate qubits and apply optimal control techniques. You
can find the source code and install instructions on
https://github.com/qutech/qopt.

The documentation is structured in the three parts 'Features',
'Example Applications' and the 'API Documentation'. The first part introduces
the qopt functionalities step by step and serves as learning tutorial for new
users and also as reference material for experienced users. The 'Example
Applications' combines an educational introduction to physical phenomena with
simulation techniques and theoretical background information. Last but not
least, you can find the full API Documentation in the last section.
