    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is written in python for the simulation and optimal control of\n",
    "noisy quantum bits (qubits). This notebook briefly summarizes its features and\n",
    "the scope of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum computer is modeled by its Hamiltonian consisting of a control term\n",
    "$H_c$, a drift term $H_d$ and a noise term $H_n$. The total Hamiltonian reads\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "H(t) = H_c(t) + H_d(t) + H_n(t).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For computational feasibility we assume piece-wise constant control, e.g. that\n",
    "the control and drift Hamiltonian $H_c + H_d$ changes only at discrete points\n",
    "in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise Hamiltonian $H_n$ models arbitrary unitary noise terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "For noise described by an arbitrary spectral density, Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "can be used to average\n",
    "fidelities over explicitly generated noise realizations. These can be created\n",
    "either by sampling noise distributions or with the help of random number\n",
    "generators. Monte Carlo simulations are universally applicable but\n",
    "computationally expensive for fast noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lindblad Master Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoherence effects in the special case of white noise can be modeled by a\n",
    "master equation in Lindblad form. The resulting propagators are not unitary and\n",
    "can describe dissipative effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This package has an interface to the filter\n",
    "function package (https://github.com/qutech/filter_functions) written by Tobias\n",
    "Hangleiter for the estimation of fidelities\n",
    "in the presence of universal unitary noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Leakage is modeled by an extension of the Hilbert space by leakage states in\n",
    "the form of a vector space sum. The simulation is then performed in the larger\n",
    "space and truncated to the computational space afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage a given noisy quantum computer to its full potential, optimal\n",
    "control techniques can be applied to mitigate the detrimental effects of noise.\n",
    "The package allows the use of different optimization algorithms by a strong\n",
    "modularity in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient based optimization algorithms such as GRAPE have proven to be\n",
    "versatile and reliable for the application in pulse optimization. For the\n",
    "efficient calculation of gradients, the package implements analytical\n",
    "derivatives for the solution of the Schroedinger equation, the master\n",
    "equation in Lindblad form and all calculations used to estimate fidelities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pulse Parametrization\n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical applications the optimization parameters are not identical\n",
    "with the control amplitudes in the Hamiltonian. The parametrization must\n",
    "of course be considered in the calculation of analytical derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To model realistic control electronics the package includes transfer functions\n",
    "mapping the requested pulse to the actual provided voltages. This can include\n",
    "for example exponential saturation to consider finite voltage rise times in\n",
    "pulse generators, Gaussian smoothing of pulses, linear transformations or even\n",
    "the measured response of an arbitrary waveform generator to a set of input\n",
    "voltages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Amplitude Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A differentiable functional relation between the optimization parameters and\n",
    "the control amplitudes can be expressed in the amplitude functions. This can\n",
    "for example be the exchange energy $J(\\epsilon)= J_0 e^{\\epsilon / \\epsilon_0}$\n",
    "and the voltage detuning $\\epsilon$ of a double quantum dot used in\n",
    "semiconductor spin qubits. Another example are triangular functions of time and\n",
    "voltage when considering quadrature control of qubits in the frame of Rabi\n",
    "driving.\n"
